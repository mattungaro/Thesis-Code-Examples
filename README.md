# Thesis_Code_Examples

gathering_permits_agg_Hurdle_Breakpoint.rmd - Using the tidyverse, knitr, zoo, and segmented packages, I gathered, prepared, and analyzed my data using specially designed
functions for hurdle model analyses and breakpoint model analyses. Note that this is not my final script used in my final analysis, but it highlights the different aspects
of the work that I did on this project. 

statistical_analysis_sample.r - A simple analysis of my data once I added in new information from a recently released 2020 dataset. This includes basic summary statistics.

statistical_analysis_sample2_supplementary_material.r - This is additional supplementary analyses included in my final paper outside of the main body of my thesis. This analysis
includes an analysis of the wetland credit market before the Stream Mitigation Method (SMM), my policy of interest, the supply of credits before and after the SMM, and an 
analysis with the Coincident Economic Index (Crone and Clayton-Matthews 2005) included as a variable. 

Other Documents:

- Three csvs sharing my aggregated data at three different points in time. The second one (5/20) includes added credit demand variables. The 5.22 file contains even more 
variables, including credit supply (termed cred_P in my dataset).

- My summarized thesis pdf document - this gives anyone a rough idea of some of my analyses for this thesis project. However, it does not contain my hurdle, OLS, and breakpoint
analysis results, beyond simple graphs visualizing the change in demand for impacts and mitigation of wetland and stream resources and the change in supply of mitigation
credits. My whole thesis is avaiable upon request.
